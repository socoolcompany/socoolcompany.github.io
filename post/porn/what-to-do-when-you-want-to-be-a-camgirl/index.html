<p>A camgirl is also sometimes called a webcam model. These chicks get in front of their webcams and perform, just chat, tease, it all depends on the woman and her boundaries. So, you want to try your hand at being a camgirl right? But you have some questions, <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-sex-cam-sites/">how do you become a camgirl</a>? How much do camgirls make? How to be a <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-webcam-girls/">good camgirl</a>? Let’s discuss all that and more right here.</p>

<p>There is some pretty basic camgirl 101 that all camgirls should follow, not all of them do but you should if you want to be safe and successful. The first step is going to be dealing with all of your social media.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/camgirls-101.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/camgirls-101.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lock it down tight:</strong> You do not want some weirdos being able to get ahold of old posts, old photos, where you used to work, contacting friends or relatives. Make all your newer and older social media private. If you don’t mind deleting it all would probably be the safest option but not everyone wants to do that.</li>
<li><strong>Change your name on social/Create a new name:</strong> If you are using your first and last name as your camgirl name, change your social media information to something else. Use your middle name as your last name or use a nickname. Its really easy to look someone us using their first and last names, if you are doing nude modeling on your new camgirl accounts you may not want screenshots of your private parts being connected to your actual name.</li>
<li><strong>Create Camgirl Accounts:</strong> If you use Twitter, Snapchat or Facebook, create new accounts just for your camgirl fans. This way you control who is on there, who sees what and you can keep it dedicated just to your camgirl business. Post your Snapchat and twitter handles during your cam sessions, so people can follow you where you want them to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="signup-and-get-started-it-s-easy"><strong>Signup And Get Started, It’s Easy</strong></h2>

<p>Next is just the bare basics on how to be a camgirl. When you sign up for a cam site they need your real name, they need your real information because they are going to be paying you real money. You also are going to have to show your face on cam, that’s what most people log on for, to see you. If you do not want that then obviously camgirl business may not be for you but if you can get past that then its all good from here. People usually buy tokens when they are on a campsite. One token is going to be about 50 cents USD. You can set your prices sometimes so be smart about it. Math is going to be your friend to see how much you’re making.</p>

<p>The next things you are going to need involve your actual set up. You want to have all of this prepared before you actually start to cam.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/set-up.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/set-up.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Laptop:</strong> You can always use a second-hand decent laptop at first and upgrade later</li>
<li><strong>Webcam:</strong> <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/tags/hd/">HD webcams</a> are going to be best. This way there are no grainy or off colors while you are trying to be the best camgirl you can</li>
<li><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> bright lighting that highlights you and your features are going to be best</li>
<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Lingerie or good/sexy outfits are going to help you get more subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Something to play with:</strong> <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-adult-online-shops/">Toys are your friend</a> when you’re being a camgirl, get good ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="many-cam-sites-compete-for-good-new-girls"><strong>Many Cam Sites Compete For Good New Girls</strong></h2>

<p>The next step on how to be a successful camgirl is to pick a <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-sex-cam-sites/">cam site</a> to start from. There are hundreds of them out there, but you want one with a lot of traffic. <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/review/chaturbate/">Chaturbate</a> is a great site for beginners as well as <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/review/my-free-cams/">MyFreeCams</a>. Some cam sites are more competitive than others. <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-sex-cam-sites/">Check out reviews</a>, look at their applications to become a cam girl and just familiarize yourself with their site before picking one. You can even pick a private site where you’re going to be building more one on one relationships with your clients. It’s all up to you and what you prefer to do.</p>

<p>Once you have a site that you have signed up with and make sure you read your contract because you should always be able to leave and use another site, then its time to set up your profile. How to become a successful camgirl is in the details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/become-a-successful-camgirl-1.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/become-a-successful-camgirl-1.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Upload Pics:</strong> These should be tasteful and sexy. They do not have to be fully nude. Pick photos that highlight the best parts of you and draw people in</li>
<li><strong>Set your limits:</strong> Be completely clear about what you will and will not do during your show. People may try to push their limits. Stay true to what you feel comfortable doing.</li>
<li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Highlight your unique features, highlight what you enjoy, highlight what makes you stand out and what makes you special.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Sex Stuff:</strong> It doesn’t have to be all about sex. You do not want to give out any identifying information but give your clients a taste of the real you, so they feel a deeper connection and keep coming back.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="be-dependable-and-online-at-the-same-times"><strong>Be Dependable And Online At The Same Times</strong></h2>

<p>Setting your office hours and sticking to them is going to be a big part of how to be a good camgirl. This is your business and you need to treat it as such. Clients want dependability. If you say you are going to be on every day from 5-6 pm them make sure that you are on every day from 5-6. If people log on to see you and you are not there and have no excuse why then they are going to move on to the next girl. Clients of any business like to know that they are not wasting their time so once you pick your hours try to stick to them as much as possible. But make them realistic for you!</p>

<p>The biggest question about being a camgirl is not even really how to become a camgirl but is how much do camgirls make? Answering this question is a tad more difficult because each girl is going to make a different amount based on so many factors. There are camgirls making upwards of a hundred thousand dollars a year and camgirls making a couple of hundred dollars a month. There are a few different things that go into answering the question of how much do camgirls make.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/how-much-do-camgirls-make-2.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/how-much-do-camgirls-make-2.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation:</strong> How are you presenting yourself? Are you getting dressed up and really into the job? The more energy and work you put in the more money you could make</li>
<li><strong>Exposure:</strong> The more exposure a camgirl has the bigger income potential she has. Exposure brings clients</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Time in the business is going to help build your repeat clients and get your name out there. A camgirl that has been in the business for 10+ years is probably going to have a bigger clientele than a camgirl that started last week but everyone can build their repeat client list!</li>
<li><strong>Site Cut:</strong> Sites are going to take a cut of your profit, anywhere from 30-60% so make sure you factor that into the equation</li>
<li><strong>What You are Willing To Do:</strong> <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/review/im-live/">Private chats</a> have the ability to bring in more cash, the longer hours you work the higher your income can be</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-much-can-you-earn-as-a-cam-girl-a-lot"><strong>How Much Can You Earn As A Cam Girl? A Lot!</strong></h2>

<p>How much do cam girls make is not as simple as just spitting out a number as you can tell. Some of the top camgirls make 5 dollars a minute and they are working all day camming. This is their full time career. Others make 5 dollars on a bad day and you have to remember that not all days are going to be good days. Be prepared for the bad ones but don’t let them discourage you.</p>

<p>Being a cam girl is a business and if you want to start that business it’s a good idea to follow these steps or at least try to. You should know what you are getting yourself into before you dive headfirst into the water! This can be a super rewarding fun career if you take the time to build your clientele and especially if you love what you are doing! The answer to “how to be a successful camgirl” is to go out there and try your hardest at it!</p>
