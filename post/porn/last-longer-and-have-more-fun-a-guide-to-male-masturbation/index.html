<p>It’s something all dudes do but it’s not something people get educated about enough Male masturbation tips are needed because dudes need love and understanding about masturbation too. There is so much information out there and a <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-adult-online-shops/">ton of sex toys</a> that you should know about, so you can have the best masturbation sessions and sex life you can! These male masturbation tips and tricks will help you fuck better, last longer, enhance your sessions and make sure that you’re feeling as good as you can the entire time. Once you learn these male masturbation techniques you’ll never go back to your old ways.</p>

<h2 id="last-longer-in-bed"><strong>Last Longer In Bed</strong></h2>

<p>There are so many articles and stories out there about how to be healthy, but no one talks about having your cock in your hands being healthy. You should eat right, don’t smoke, drink lots of water, gets lots of sleep and on and on but the one thing people don’t talk enough about when it comes to staying healthy and happy is masturbation. Masturbation isn’t just a thing that you should do when you’re bored and sexually frustrated, and unlike what the myths and rumors say if you masturbate you’re not going to get hairy palms or lose your eyesight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/keeping-your-cock-healthy-1.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/keeping-your-cock-healthy-1.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<p>You should be masturbating as often as you can! There are so many benefits to masturbating including sleeping better, feeling better, lasting longer in bed and even just fucking feeling great after. Here we are going to talk about some hot tips, <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/best-adult-online-shops/">great sex toys</a>, ways you can spice up your solo session and more.</p>

<h2 id="some-of-the-best-orgasms-are-solo"><strong>Some of the Best Orgasms Are Solo</strong></h2>

<p>Solo orgasms are going to be some of your best orgasms’ hands down, or hands on? I mean there is no teeth hitting your cock because of a rough blow job and there’s definitely no way you can be particularly bad at making yourself cum, right? Sometimes we just need the stress relief of blowing a huge load after a hard day’s work. Even if you for some reason don’t have a lot of practice, you’ll tune into your body pretty quickly once you get started.</p>

<p>The first step to having a great man masturbation session is to set the mood. I know, sounds fucking weird but trust me it works. Masturbation doesn’t have to be this thing that you only do really quick in the bathroom, so no one knows. Plan this thing out just like anything else you would. This is about you and you should be comfortable with your hand in your cock ready to stroke it. To make your masturbation time even better you can:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/make-your-masturbation-time-even-better.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/make-your-masturbation-time-even-better.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<p>Getting comfortable and relaxed is going to make sure you can keep your head in the game. Planning it out means that no one should interrupt you and you’re not going to waste 30 minutes trying to find a <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/webcam-videos/">good video</a>. Even thinking about food can get distracting so prepare yourself for the best time ahead of time.</p>

<p>Something that people don’t always tell you and you may not know is to switch it up! Don’t always go to the same room if you don’t have to, don’t always watch the same exact video and don’t even stay in the same position. Most likely you have a smartphone or tablet that you can take to different areas of the house. Try standing instead of sitting, its more of a power move. You can also try leaning over against the wall or even over the toilet for easy cleanup, if you’re always laying down try sitting u, you can even be on all fours if you really want to get nasty.</p>

<p>It’s all up to you but switching it up is going to make your male solo orgasms so much more exciting. Switching hands is great too. Just like switching positions, switching hands can lead to different sensations which means different feelings when you are having a solo session. Exploring and trying new things is a sure way to get to a better orgasm.</p>

<h2 id="mix-up-masturbation-techniques-to-keep-it-sexy"><strong>Mix Up Masturbation Techniques To Keep It Sexy</strong></h2>

<p>Masturbation doesn’t have to be the same every time and you can switch it up even more by bringing your hips into the equation. Usually, when you’re fucking you’re moving your hips, right? Well, masturbation is just fucking yourself so get into it. Move your hips back and forth, move them in a circular motion or however you want to try it. You can try going slower or faster, whatever but moving may put you in a different mindset and it can also make things more intense.</p>

<p>There are more than just the same old <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/">porn websites</a> as well. We all know pornos exist and you probably have your favorites. There are of course pictures you can scroll through of some hottie taking all her clothes off but why not switch it up even more and try reading some nasty erotica or listening to an audiobook. These are things you can even do in the car. Put on a sexy new taboo book when you’re on your commute home and have your cock ready to burst through your zipper when you’re coming through the door. The tease of listening to porn instead of watching it may be way more stimulating than you thought. Erotic books and audiobooks aren’t just for women, you may be surprised that your cock is hungry for something different.</p>

<p>If you want to stick with videos check out some of the <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/premium-porn-sites/">pay sites</a>. They are usually better quality and have a lot more features and bonuses for some pretty decent prices plus at Mr. Porn Geek we have a ton of reviews of the best and raunchiest sites for your dollar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/porn-sites-and-books-2.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/porn-sites-and-books-2.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<p>We are talking a lot about switching things up but there are so many different things you can switch up when you’re trying new male masturbation techniques. Trying different strokes is one some people forget. Going from the base to the tip in an up and down motion is pretty normal. But how about thinking about how you want a chick to do it? Do you want her to just move her hand up and down? No. So spice it up. Try twisting your hand as you go up and down, trying massaging different parts of your cock, you can try pulling on the tip and rubbing it with your palm once it’s lubed up. The more variety you try, the easier it is to find what is best for your cock.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-the-whole-body"><strong>Focus On The Whole Body</strong></h2>

<p>Don’t just focus on your cock during a solo play session either. Sounds weird I know but don’t you love when a chick licks your balls and taint? How about when she massages around your cock before she starts to stroke it? Do that. There is no reason to ignore those areas if you know you like them played with. Or even if you don’t know you should try it out! Your nuts have just as many nerve endings as your dick does so play with them, and if you get close to nutting over that porn your watching give them a little tug and see how much more intense your orgasm is going to be.</p>

<p>There are way more erogenous zones on a man’s body than what’s just around your cock though. Surprise surprise, your nipples, lips, ears, neck, and mouth can be pretty sensitive areas too. Rub, pull on, pinch and squeeze in other areas when you’re feeling really into it and want to cum loads. See what feels best or just starts to feel good and run with it!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/erogenous-zones-on-a-man’s-body-2.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/erogenous-zones-on-a-man%E2%80%99s-body-2.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<p>Now one of the best male masturbation techniques that are out there is edging. Edging is going to get you into the habit of prolonging your solo male masturbation session but past that it’s going to teach you how to control your orgasm. The more you proactive the better you are going to be. Do you know what that leads to? Being able to last way longer and have more pleasure not only during a solo session but also with your partner. You’re going to start out by taking your cock in your hands and getting yourself right there on the edge of an orgasm and just when you think you’re about to cum you’re going to stop completely. But Mr. Porn Geek why would I want to do that?! I know, it sounds miserable but hear me out. Yore going to stop and then work yourself up again slowly. You’re going to keep repeating this process and once you do finally get to bust a load it’s going to be one of the best orgasms you have ever had. Plus, you will be able to last longer and longer the more you do this meaning you can fuck women longer and longer as well.</p>

<h2 id="solo-sex-toys-can-help-a-lot"><strong>Solo Sex Toys Can Help A Lot</strong></h2>

<p>Now that you’ve got all the basics down that you should know here’s where it gets really fun. Male masturbation toys, yes, they exist and yes, they are fucking great. You hear a lot about female masturbation toys, but dudes have them too and they make solo male orgasm way fucking more fun. The best male masturbation toys are easy to find once you know what they actually do. Here are a few and a basic idea of what they do:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/toys-for-male-masturbation.jpg"><img src="https://www.mrporngeek.com/wp-content/uploads/toys-for-male-masturbation.jpg" alt="img" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic Stroker: These bad boys are going to stroke your dick on their own, kind of like a fleshlight mixed with a robot.</li>
<li>Fleshlights: feels similar to a vagina or asshole, it’s a sleeve that you put your dick in and use to jerk yourself off</li>
<li>Penis Pump: stick your cock in the tube, pump it and you’re going to be bigger and more enlarged. The more swollen you are the more sensitive you can be</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/review/joylovedolls/">Love Dolls</a>: Wanna fuck a toy, use a doll that’s shaped like your <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/pornstars/">favorite porn star</a>! They have full bodies, just the torso, pussy or ass regions. Whatever you are into they probably made a sex doll out of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are so many more male masturbation toys and male masturbation machine options out there these are just scratching the surface! Add one or more to your male masturbation solo session to really enhance your experience.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your perfect male masturbation toy to use or if you’re just going to forgo the toys all together you can try different lubricants as well. Of course, good old spit works fine, spit on your hand and go to town if you want too but there are so many more options to make sure your cock stays wet the whole time.</p>

<h2 id="lube-is-your-dick-s-best-friend"><strong>Lube Is Your Dick’s Best Friend</strong></h2>

<p>Water-based lubricants are great, but they can dry out quicker, so you are going to have to reply as necessary. Silicone-based lubes are going to last longer than a water-based and its like silk on your privates, soft, smooth and you’re going to be able to jack it way easier. If you don’t want to worry about reapplying anything at all then use an oil-based lubricant. You’re going to be able to go for quite a while without ever thinking about getting dry! But if you’re using a toy or you have an allergy make sure that the lube you are using is safe for your male masturbation toys or male masturbation machines and also for your skin.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that there are a lot of masturbation techniques for men that can make your male solo session the best. You have the options of toys, switching things up, different lubricants and even <a href="https://www.mrporngeek.com/blog/benefits-of-watching-porn/">different ways to watch porn</a>. Masturbation tips should be talked about way more so dudes can fuck better, last longer and enjoy solo session ways more. Masturbation is healthy for you and it can be way more enjoyable than you thought.</p>
