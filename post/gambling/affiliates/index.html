          <p>Hand in hand with <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/casinos">online casinos</a> come affiliates and <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/affiliate-programs">casino affiliate programs</a>, which can cover a wide variety of games like poker, casino, sports and bingo. Affiliate marketing is known as a type of performance-based marketing that was first put into practise and patented by a William J. Tobin who was the founder of PC Flowers &amp; Gifts. A business will reward one or more affiliates for each and every visitor or customer that is brought via the affiliate’s own marketing efforts.</p>

<p>Since its inception, affiliate marketing has grown at a staggering rate and there are now countless programs that help advertise online casinos. It is estimated that in 2006 alone the total sales generated through affiliate networks was £2.16 billion in the UK, while affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5 billion. This included commissions from a variety of sources, such as gambling and gaming, retail, personal finance, travel, education and telecoms. In 2006 gambling was one of the most active sectors of affiliate marketing, alongside retail services and file-sharing services.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/affiliates-2-5a12a09a7528f7df588b4806.jpg" alt="Affiliates" /></p>

<p>Many players are actually under the assumption that the word &lsquo;affiliate&rsquo; is associated with some kind of scam, when in fact this is far from the real truth. Casino affiliates are there to help players as much as possible so <strong>players can have a stress-free gaming experience</strong> and they certainly help in more ways than one. Instead of a player having to spend all their time browsing through the endless list of casinos on a search engine, they can simply turn to an affiliate website, such as <strong>AskGamblers</strong>. Affiliates collate all this information in one easy-to-use, safe environment. The website will have a list of casinos that players can choose to play at and, most importantly, each casino will usually involve a fully detailed review along with player ratings. Such information can be extremely useful to help a player decide where they want to play and can help players avoid rogue casinos, eliminating the element of disappointment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Affiliate programs are designed to help players choose the best possible casino to play in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Affiliate  programs promote casinos in a number of different ways and will often provide a review based on a number of different factors. Those casinos that may not meet a certain criteria by the affiliate will usually be placed under &lsquo;rogue casinos&rsquo; in order to give the player the best possible chance of choosing the right casino to play in. Each different affiliate will have their own review program for each casino and will present this to players in different forms. Generally those casinos that are rated highly by an affiliate will work well with the actual affiliate and have a good track record when it comes to aspects such as <strong>fairness, customer support and communication</strong>. It is very important for each and every affiliate to know their market and understand players’ needs in order to promote online casinos.</p>

<p>AskGamblers is the leading gambling portal in the world, when it comes to complaint resolution between players and casinos. <strong>You can submit a complaint at any time at AskGamblers</strong> and it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it’s an issue with payments, bonuses or anything else casino-related and the process could not be easier. All you need to do is find the casino you wish to submit a complaint about and write exactly what your complaint is. AskGamblers will then take it from there and the great thing is any comments that are made from the casino will be available for you to view and reply. AskGamblers believes that players deserve to have a fair game each and every time they play. Although most players experience no problems at all, we are here for you in case you do experience foul play in any way. Players can also examine the AskGamblers&rsquo; complete archive of casino complaints to help you pick where to play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Affiliate programs can promote online casinos in many different forms - via simple banner ads or informational and trustworthy websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Affiliate programs will choose to promote online casinos to their target market in many different forms, which could include simple banner ads or via informational and trustworthy websites. As an affiliate, it is their job not only to convince players to visit an online casino, but also to go ahead with an offer or a deposit at that specific casino. Affiliate programs will also have a selection of bonuses and promotions for each casino that is listed, as well as exclusive bonuses that players can claim by using the affiliate programs. Affiliate programs advertise on behalf of online casinos. They may choose to advertise in a number of different ways. These can include the publication of player reviews and official reviews, display advertising, email advertising and many more. Players often overlook affiliates, but they actually play a significant role with online casino advertising.</p>

<p>Another important feature and service that an affiliate website may offer is <strong>a complaint process</strong>. Players can turn to affiliates in the unfortunate event they have a problem with an online casino to submit a complaint and the affiliates will then look at helping the player via the casinos to resolve the complaint.</p>

<p>Another service that players may be overlooking by not using an affiliate website is <strong>an online forum</strong>. Such forums are usually casino-related, providing players with an opportunity to chat with other players about specific experiences in casinos. Alternatively, they can just be used to gather information about casinos. Again, these can also play a vital role in a player choosing the right casino to play in.</p>

<p>There are many forms of compensation methods that affiliates use. It is estimated that eighty percent of online affiliate programs today use <strong>revenue sharing</strong> or pay per sale which is also known as PPS. Approximately nineteen percent use <strong>cost per acquisition (also known as CPA) model</strong> and it is said the remaining affiliate programs use other methods like cost per click and cost per mile (cost per estimated 1000 views). These methods of compensation are called predominant compensation methods. Both cost per click and cost per mile are less used these days due to click fraud issues and these methods have diminished over time. Affiliate marketing is also known worldwide as &lsquo;<strong>performance-based marketing</strong>&rsquo; which refers to how sales employees are typically being compensated. When referring to performance marketing employees are paid for each and every sale they successfully close. It is important to remember that affiliates are not actually employed by the advertisers whose services and products they are promoting. However, the compensation models that are applied to affiliate marketing are indeed very similar to the ones that are used for people in the advertiser’s internal sales department.</p>

<p>There are many preconceptions when it comes to affiliate marketing. The phrase &ldquo;Affiliates are an extended sales force for a business&rdquo;, which is often used when trying to explain an affiliate program, is not actually accurate. There is one primary difference between the two, which is that affiliate marketers actually provide very little influence, if any, on a possible prospect involved in the conversion process once that prospect is directed to an advertiser’s website. However, on the other hand, a sales team of an advertiser does indeed have control and a lot of influence up to the point where the prospect signs a contract or completes a purchase transaction.</p>

<p>Casino affiliates may offer <strong>multi-tier program</strong>s where commission is distributed through a network of sign-ups and sub-partners. A player will sign up to a casino through an affiliate link and the advertiser (the affiliate) will get rewarded for the agreed actions that have been conducted. Some sign-ups may involve a specific and exclusive sign-up code. If a player uses this code initially all future activities performed by the player will result in additional commission being paid to the affiliate.</p>

<p>As with any business, affiliate programs have experienced both past and current issues. Since the launch of affiliate marketing there has not been much control over affiliate activity. It is reported that some affiliates have used things like spam, false advertising and forced clicks in order to try and increase traffic to their specific sponsors. Many players may hold negative comments towards affiliates because of this, but in the latter years, as affiliates have matured, good and reputable affiliates will contain their very own terms of service that will contain strict rules against the use of spam.</p>

<p>Ultimately, affiliates play a huge part in advertising online casinos, and a reputable affiliate website’s main focus is to help players and not to hinder them. As casinos and the gambling industry continues to grow, so will affiliate websites.</p>
