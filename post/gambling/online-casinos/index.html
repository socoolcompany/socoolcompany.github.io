<p>There is currently an extensive amount of <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casino-reviews">online casinos</a> that can be found on the internet today. Online casinos are also less frequently referred to as &lsquo;virtual casinos&rsquo;. More and more these days people are looking to gamble with the convenience of online casinos. Online casinos provide players with a facility and service to place real money wagers on certain games through their own internet access, <strong>offering a huge convenience</strong> compared to a land-based casino.</p>

<p>Online casinos may often be compared to land-based casinos when it comes to odds and percentages. Generally online casinos do offer higher percentages than land-based casinos. As land casinos have higher operating costs, online casinos are able to beat their competitors with these <strong>higher payouts and lucrative bonuses and promotions</strong>. Online casinos often provide hundreds, if not thousands of casino games through a specific casino software and these games often include <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/slot-games">video slots</a>, table games and video poker games from software providers like Net Entertainment, Microgaming, Playtech, to name a few.</p>

<h2 id="online-casinos-https-www-askgamblers-com-uploads-original-online-casinos-2-5a12a07b7528f7895d8b456d-jpg"><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/online-casinos-2-5a12a07b7528f7895d8b456d.jpg" alt="Online Casinos" /></h2>

<p>Players can choose to play at an online casino generally through three different types of play. These are: instantly via <strong>a flash browser,</strong> via <strong>a download-based casino</strong> and via a <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casinos/mobile-casinos">mobile casino</a>, which is usually compatible with devices like smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>A flash casino allows players to instantly play games through a browser using a flash plug-in. Without this flash plug-in the casino games will not load. On the other hand, some casinos require players to download a simple software client, which means the support of a flash browser is not required. This can often mean players have access to the casino’s full suite of games. The convenience of an online casino allows players to easily switch between games and even play multiple games at the same time. These downloads are generally safe for computers and are quick and easy to install. As well as full access to games, players will also gain access to other casino features such as banking, transactions, game history and loyalties and rewards.</p>

<p>An even more convenient way of online gambling now is mobile gaming. As technology has advanced, many online casinos have now brought out a mobile version of their casinos. Players can access a selection of the casinos games on the smartphone and tablet devices. There are many different platforms that these casinos can be accessed on which include the Apple iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows.</p>

<p>While there are still certain casinos that don&rsquo;t yet offer a full scope of casino games on mobile devices, more often than not players can freely use casinos on their smartphones and tablets just like on desktops, thanks to the advancement of technology.</p>

<p>A huge part of players gambling in an online casino is customer satisfaction, and this is something that casinos specifically focus on on a daily basis. Therefore, casinos ensure they offer <strong>numerous support options</strong>, so players can communicate with them whenever possible. Support usually comes in many different forms, which can include live chat, email, telephone, Skype, postal address, the most efficient and the most popular probably being an online live chat facility. Some casinos will offer this service <strong>24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,</strong> whilst others may have certain opening times for this service. Reputable casinos often become &lsquo;reputable&rsquo; by the level of support they offer, and online casinos know that this can have a massive impact on how players feel when playing at their casino.</p>

<h2 id="bonuses-and-promotions">Bonuses and promotions</h2>

<p>Competition between online casinos is fierce. They all fight for the number one spot when it comes to factors like bonuses and promotions, they all want the best to attract the most number of players and it is important for a casino to build up <strong>trust and loyalty</strong> with each and every player in order for that player to keep playing there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The type of bonuses a typical casino may offer are Free Spins, deposit bonuses, no deposit bonuses, cashback offers and also competitions, tournaments and many more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The type of bonuses a typical casino may offer are <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/free-spins">Free Spins</a>, deposit bonuses, no deposit bonuses, cashback offers and also competitions, tournaments and many more. Probably the most popular bonus a casino will offer is their sign-up bonus also known as a &lsquo;welcome bonus&rsquo;. A casino may offer various different welcome bonuses to suit a player’s needs and depending on how much a player is planning on deposit may also be correlated with the amount of welcome bonus they qualify for.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/welcome-bonus">welcome bonus</a> may also consist of more than one bonus. A casino may be able to offer a player a multi-tiered welcome bonus, which means a player would be able to claim a bonus on their first deposit and multiple deposits thereafter, like their second and third. More often than not a welcome bonus may consist of a 100% deposit match bonus, and for every subsequent deposit they may be offered a lower amount. Alternatively, this could be reversed.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-bonus">Welcome bonus</h2>

<p>Welcome bonuses may also vary depending on the type of game a player is wishing to play. For example, a casino may offer a welcome bonus to play online slots or to play table games. As with any bonus, <strong>they will also carry a wagering requirement</strong>. This means, if a player accepts a bonus from a casino, they will be bound to certain terms before they are able to withdraw any of their winnings. Wagering requirements vary depending on each individual casino, and a player is required to play through a certain amount of money on certain games before they can request a withdrawal. There may be an exception to this rule at certain online casinos that will allow players to forfeit a bonus in order to make a withdrawal.</p>

<h2 id="no-deposit-bonus">No deposit bonus</h2>

<p>Another very popular bonus offered by online casinos worldwide are called <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/no-deposit-bonus">no deposit bonuses.</a> The reason these bonuses are so popular is obvious from the name - <strong>no deposit is required</strong> in order to claim this kind of bonus. Many online casinos may offer a no deposit bonus as a sign up bonus before offering a welcome bonus. This is a great form of marketing for casinos as they are primarily there to entice players to the casino. Upon registration players can be rewarded a no deposit bonus in order to try out the casino games and get a feel of the casino. As with any other bonus they do, of course, come with wagering requirements. Again, this is dependent on each individual casino and will be stated in the Terms and Conditions of the bonus.</p>

<h2 id="progressive-jackpot-games">Progressive jackpot games</h2>

<p>Some casinos may restrict the bonus to be played on certain games and some casinos may also restrict the use of <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/free-slots/progressive">progressive jackpot games</a> when playing through the bonus. Once a player fully meets the requirements of a bonus, generally they will be free to withdraw their winnings up to a maximum amount that would again be stated in the Terms of the bonus. More often than not a small deposit may be required from the player before they can request a withdrawal in order for the casino to verify the identity of a player. This deposit is then normally added onto the withdrawal amount. Sometimes no deposit bonuses are not cashable, which means once the playthrough requirement has been met and a player makes a withdrawal, the original bonus amount will be deducted from the withdrawal. In fact, this can be the case for any bonus offered to a player, not just no deposit bonuses. No deposit bonuses are not only offered on registration, they can also be offered to players at any time. Sometimes casinos will give players these bonuses as a gesture of goodwill, as part of special promotions or for celebrations such as a player’s birthday. These bonuses can also be given in the form of a cash bonus or Free Spins.</p>

<h2 id="refer-a-friend">Refer a Friend</h2>

<p>An online casino may also offer other types of bonuses, such as refer-a-friend bonuses. A player may be entitled to refer a friend to a casino and they can both benefit from this referral in terms of a bonus. Again, this bonus may be tied to certain playthrough requirements.</p>

<h2 id="cashback-bonus">Cashback bonus</h2>

<p>A casino may also be able to offer player cashback bonuses. Although these kind of bonuses may not be as popular as other bonuses, they can be a major advantage for players. They are often given in the form of a percentage depending on player’s losses in previous gaming activities.</p>

<h2 id="comp-points">Comp points</h2>

<p>Lastly, another form of <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casino-bonus/">online bonus</a> that casinos may offer is something called <strong>&lsquo;comp points&rsquo; or &lsquo;player points&rsquo;.</strong> These points are earned by players whilst placing real money wagers on games within the casino. Once these points reach a certain amount, the player is able to convert them to cash or various prizes. Even though the amount of points awarded per wager may be relatively small, the points can be earned over a long period of time and converted at the player’s convenience. Online casinos may also offer <strong>certain VIP bonus programs</strong> to ensure overall player satisfaction is maintained.</p>

<h2 id="payment-methods">Payment Methods</h2>

<p>Casinos often offer players <strong>a range of ways to deposit</strong> and also to withdraw. The types of payment methods often include credit and debit cards, bank transfer and a method that has become very popular over the last few years, e-wallet, such as Skrill and Neteller. Many casinos also allow players to deposit via Ukash or Paysafe vouchers and even Paypal. Such payment methods often need to be verified, should a player wish to make a withdrawal.</p>

<p>Making a deposit at a casino is not complicated at all and is only a matter of minutes. Whilst deposits are usually processed instantly, withdrawals may take a little longer. Online casinos will have certain security encryption to ensure sensitive data, such as credit card information, is kept secure at all times. Withdrawals often involve verification procedures which may involve players sending in documents like passports, driver’s licence, utility bills and front and back of credit or debit cards. <strong>Each casino will be different and will have their own verification procedures</strong>. Once these procedures have been verified by the casino’s security department, they are not usually requested again.</p>

<h2 id="video-slots-and-casino-games">Video Slots and Casino Games</h2>

<p>Online casinos offer a huge variety of different games to play, and whilst the most popular game at an online casino may be slots, there is actually a lot more to offer players than just slots. <strong>Video slots</strong> are extremely easy to play and require no skill at all and they can also produce some big wins for players placing relatively small bets. This may be a major reason slots have become so popular over the last years. Additionally, slots come in all shapes and size and can be chosen according to various criteria, from how many paylines are offered, over the diversity of bonus features and payouts, all the way to the quality of graphics and animations. Each software provider constantly fights to bring out the newest, best slots and the competition in the iGaming industry is indeed fierce.</p>

<p>Players are also given a variety of classic slots that may be similar to the ones you can find in a land-based casino. This type of slots may offer three reels, as opposed to five-reel video slots which may contain 3D graphics.</p>

<p>Another form of slot machines players can bet on are progressive jackpot slots. These slots can often see players winning in excess of a million dollars/pounds. Everything you find in Las Vegas, like dazzling lights and sounds, can usually be found in your average slot machine and they often bring excitement and entertainment, as well as big wins.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can find <strong>table games and card games</strong> in most online casinos. These types of games include a huge diversity of different casino games, which can include variants of blackjack, roulette, poker and many other games, too. Players who like these casino games may enjoy applying strategy to their games to try and improve their chances of winning in future games. The fact that this may prove to be a real challenge might be a reason these kind of games are also very popular.</p>

<p>Another highly ranked online casino game is <strong>video poker</strong>. Again, these games are largely available at most online casinos, where a selection of different variants is usually offered. Each individual video poker game will offer players a different payout ratio, depending on the bets that are placed and each game will also have different strategies for players to learn and to maximize the chances of winning. The playing time involved with video poker games may be much longer than those of table and card games, which may be a reason these casino games are so popular. Online casinos usually offer a range of poker tournaments, which are great for both beginners and advanced players, and are an opportunity to win some extra cash, too.</p>

<p>A lot of online casinos, although not all of them, also offer <strong>live dealer casino games</strong>. Live games are run by a human dealer of the game and the game runs in real time from a casino gaming table. These games can often be viewed via a live streaming video link. Players will usually have the facility to place their bets via their laptops and desktops and will also be able to communicate with the dealer. The results of these games are determined by real-life actions, rather than an automated process, like all other games that are found in online casinos. The reason these kind of games are not offered at every online casino is probably due to the cost of the service. Each online casino that provides these kind of games will have their own individual setup to attract players.</p>

<p>Online casinos offer a safe and exciting environment for players who enjoy gambling online and the majority of players will have an easy and enjoyable experience. However, whilst there will always be a few gamblers that will be unlucky and may experience problems, it is important to realize that this is not just the case for online casinos and that it can happen with any business that choose to operate their services online.</p>
