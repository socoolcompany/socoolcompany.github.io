<p>In 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Federal Wire Act prohibited electronic transmission of information for sports betting across all telecommunication lines, but affirmed a lower court ruling that in fact the Wire Act &ldquo;in plain language&rdquo; does not actually prohibit internet gambling on a game of chance. Some states, however, do indeed have specific laws in place that prohibit online gambling. Still, many do not. In order for an online gaming company to launch their business, a license from the state is a requirement.</p>

<p>The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, also known as the UIGEA, was introduced in the House of Representatives on the 5th of April, 2006 in the United States, and it is a legislation that regulates online gambling. President George W. Bush signed into the law in 2006 and Senator Bill Frist went ahead and attached the legislation to an unrelated port-security bill, which happened just moments before it was actually voted on, thus guaranteeing its passing.</p>

<h2 id="uigea-and-why-it-changed-the-whole-industry-https-www-askgamblers-com-uploads-original-uigea-and-why-it-changed-the-whole-industry-2-5a12a0b37528f73f5e8b4573-jpg"><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/uigea-and-why-it-changed-the-whole-industry-2-5a12a0b37528f73f5e8b4573.jpg" alt="UIGEA and why it changed the whole industry" /></h2>

<p>The introduction of the UIGEA&rsquo;s unexpected enactment created industry hysteria. The UIGEA &ldquo;prohibits gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or wager that involves the use of the internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law&rdquo;. This law dictates regulations on how gambling transactions can be processed online. The Act being enforced was set to take the industry by storm and it made changes that will probably never be undone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Act specifically excluded fantasy sports, legal intrastate and inter-tribal gaming. It did not mention state lotteries, neither did it clarify whether inter-state wagering on horse racing was legal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the Act specifically excluded fantasy sports that met certain requirements, and legal intrastate and inter-tribal gaming. The Act does not mention state lotteries, neither does it actually clarify whether inter-state wagering on horse racing is legal. The Act meant that online gambling sites that were listed on the London Stock Exchange and similar markets stopped accepting players from the United States, due to the passing of this Act.</p>

<p>After the Act was put into place, stock prices of publicly-traded e-casinos plummeted, which in turn wiped out over approximately seven billion dollars of market value. Many US players thought this meant they were prohibited from playing, but contrary to popular belief, this law does not prohibit US players from taking part in online gambling. The fact of the matter remains that the Act does not actually prohibit US players from doing anything, because the Act is not targeted at addressing players activities. <strong>The law is directed at online gambling site operators and payment processors</strong> with the intent of curtailing fraud, money laundering and any other illegal financial crimes that are being committed via online gambling activities. Findings from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission largely fuelled this law.</p>

<p>The Act requires Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate regulations which requires certain participants in payment systems that could be used for unlawful Internet gambling to have their policies and their procedures reasonably designed to block and identify or to prevent or prohibit the processing of restricted online transactions. There are five designated payment systems covered by the act that were issued as a joint rule by the Treasury and Federal Reserve Board. They are as follows: <strong>automated clearing house systems, card systems, check collection systems, money transmitting businesses and wire transfer systems</strong>. This rule exempts certain participants from the requirement of having policies and procedures. However, no exemptions whatsoever are made for card system participants. The reason for this is because card systems usually carry a transaction coding system. This coding system permits potential restricted transactions to be segregated by participants during the authorisation process.</p>

<p>Both the United States and Antigua have been in dispute for a very long time regarding the concerns of the USA restrictions when it comes to online gambling and, in the year of 2007 (January), the World Trade Organization handed down a ruling. The ruling was that the United States was actually violating treaty obligations by prohibiting full market access to online gambling businesses. All of these businesses in question were based in the country of Antigua. On the 30th of March, 2007, the United States officially lost the case. This later led to both Antigua and the European Union filing claims for compensation against the United States, which came after the World Trade Organization ruling. However, due to national security, the dispute was settled through the granting of concessions that was kept secret.</p>

<p>In May 2009, the UIGEA was challenged by Congressman Barney Frank. He actually introduced a bill which was to overturn the gambling aspects of the Act. The bill was set to further protect American citizens from fraud, whilst safeguarding against both problem and underage gamblers. But this was not all. Frank also introduced a bill in order to delay the UIGEA being implemented for a whole year until December 2010. However, regulations were actually only extended until June 2010. If this bill had been passed, it would have meant that online poker would have immediately been exempted from the UIGEA. Still, the bill never did make it out of the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The iMEGA&rsquo;s case was essentially that the UIGEA was unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UIGEA saw further challenges in September 2009 when the iMEGA, the Interactive Media Entertainment &amp; Gaming Association, brought the law to a US Federal Circuit court. The iMEGA&rsquo;s case was essentially that the UIGEA was unconstitutional. The 3rd Circuit Court actually upheld the UIGEA as a law, but as a result they set a precedent of enforcement and legitimacy on the United States. The iMEGA lost their case, but they felt that this bought them a small victory. At the time of the verdict, only six out of fifty US states had laws that specifically outlawed online gambling.</p>

<p>The UIGEA of course largely affected the online gambling industry and initially many gambling sites and payment processors thought the best way was to exit the United States gambling market. this meant they were no longer to provide their services online to US players. The majority of brands that were listed on the London Stock Exchange did actually decide to depart, but there were still several prominent privately owned businesses that continued to accept players from the United States of America. Credit card companies and banks that were based in the United States started to reject all online gambling related transactions and all digital wallet companies also chose to exit the United States market. The passing of the UIGEA resulted in a reduced selection for players from the United States regarding viable payment processors and, of course, online reputable gambling sites.</p>

<p>Even though the enactment of the UIGEA caused mayhem within the gambling industry, it did start to settle down and stabilize over time. Now there are once again online payment solutions. These new payment solutions now facilitate the processing of online gambling related transactions for players who reside in the United States. There is also a very healthy and a vast amount of online gambling sites that offer wagering services to residents of the United States of America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t only negative impacts on the industry as a result of the UIGEA -  the enactment of the UIGEA law included a safer and more reliable online gambling payment infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There weren&rsquo;t only negative impacts on the industry as a result of the UIGEA; in fact, there were some positive outcomes, too. The enactment of the UIGEA law includes a much safer and more reliable online gambling payment infrastructure. Payment processors and online gambling sites were forced to make vast improvements to their standards and their investments thus providing a much higher quality gambling environment that is viable for US players. For the online gambling sites that are operating legitimately within the industry, there is nothing that states in the UIGEA that prohibits players from America from participating in their activities online. The UIGEA also did not curtail players legal rights to participate at legal offshore Internet gambling destinations. Alternative banking solutions have now re-emerged, such as prepaid credit and debit cards and digital e-wallets, which have also come back on the US market. These payment methods are, however, restricted to state-licensed online gambling only.</p>

<p>Players should be aware that they are certainly <strong>not breaking the law if they gamble at an offshore online gambling site</strong>. It is very important to remember that the law only applies to the actual processing of gambling related transactions and in no way are players’ activities addressed. Players are well within their rights to engage in responsible online gambling at legally licensed and regulated gambling sites.</p>
