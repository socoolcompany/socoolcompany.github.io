<p>Software companies are those companies that provide the hundreds of games you find in an <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casino-reviews">online casino</a> and there is a multitude of software companies out there. Naturally, there are certain software companies that dominate the industry and those that are not so successful. Generally, online casinos may lease or even purchase their software from the individual providers. Some of the leading software providers include <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/microgaming">Microgaming</a>, <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/netent">Net Entertainment</a> (NetEnt), <strong>Playtech, Real Time Gaming, Cryptologic, Rival, IGT</strong> and <strong>WMS.</strong></p>

<p>Since the year 2011 there has been a significant increase in the number of software providers online and today there are dozens of companies that provide online casinos with their software. Even though there are many software providers, each and every one of the providers will offer their own very unique product. They all strive to create their own defining look, style and feel of their games and provide their own <strong>different attributes to attract players to their games.</strong> It is quite common for players to find a software that they enjoy and then look for different casinos that provide this software. With a lot of casinos providing multi software platforms these days, players are often able to play at casinos that power a few of their favourite software platforms, putting all of their favourite games in one place, making the entire experience more wholesome.</p>

<h2 id="gaming-software-companies-https-www-askgamblers-com-uploads-original-i-2-c-gaming-software-companies-59d5f41e7528f782038b45c1-jpg"><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/i-2-c-gaming-software-companies-59d5f41e7528f782038b45c1.jpg" alt="Gaming software companies" /></h2>

<p>The technology provided by software providers is often available for platforms which include <strong>Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.</strong> This opens up many different options for all types of players with only one real requirement needed, which is generally a good internet connection. Different software platforms will allow players to change optimal settings of their games in order to define them to best suit the players’ devices. However, these settings do not ever need to be changed. It is purely a customer’s decision, so players that may have a slower connection are still able to play the games happily.</p>

<p>Choosing the right software supplier can be tricky, as the games provided by each provider can vary a vast amount.</p>

<p>Choosing the right software company for you can be tricky, as the games provided by each provider can vary a vast amount. Some software companies may only offer a certain type of game, whilst others may have many different variants of games. Something that is becoming more and more popular these days are casinos that provide <strong>multi-platform software</strong>. Players can choose to play in a casino that may offer games from three, four or five different providers, which increases the variety of games you can play. Most software companies also allow their games to be played in free mode, as well as real mode.</p>

<h2 id="microgaming">Microgaming</h2>

<p>Microgaming is one of the most trusted software providers in the industry and it is important to know a bit about the providers before playing their games. Microgaming was founded back in 1994 and is a privately held Isle of Man-based software development company. Their first genuine online casino using their software was released in the year 1994. Microgaming&rsquo;s products include online casino, mobile, poker, bingo, land-based, sportsbook, live dealer and network gaming.</p>

<p>Microgaming has built up an impressive collection of hundreds of games. They also publish a mix of licensed and proprietary content, keeping their catalogue of games fresh every single month. The providers are also leaders in the mobile gaming industry, producing games that are just as easy to play on mobile and tablet devices, as they are on desktop devices. Their mobile collection of games has now substantially increased in the last few years. Microgaming has actually generated some of the biggest recorded mobile gaming wins in the history of online gambling and their progressive jackpot games are, in fact, the largest in the world with the progressive jackpot network. <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casinos/mobile-casinos">Mobile casinos</a> are also now providing games from various software providers and providers, e.g. NetEnt’s very own mobile software NetEnt Touch!</p>

<p>Microgaming is a founding member of <strong>eCOGRA and IRC</strong>, which are the Interactive Gaming Council, and they certainly set a very high standard when it comes to fairness and responsible gaming.  They have also produced some world leading slots that have become very popular amongst players all over the world. For example, the <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/game/slots/thunderstruck-2-g3259">Thunderstruck 2 slot</a> is a very popular 243 ways slot and ranks in Microgaming’s top ten slots. This slot has paid out some staggering amounts to players in its time. Another popular 243-ways-to-win slot Microgaming has to its name is the <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/game/slots/immortal-romance-g3978">Immortal Romance slot</a>. Again, this slot pays out amazing wins and is popular with both new and experienced gamblers. Both of these slots entices players with four different sets of Free Spins which have to be unlocked as players progress through the game. Each set of Free Spins offer players a lucrative multiplier or feature. Both slots also have a wild random feature, unleashing full reels of wilds, which makes these slots extremely popular. Other big names among the Microgaming slots include the <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/game/slots/thunderstruck-g1748">Thunderstruck slot</a>, <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/game/slots/break-da-bank-again-g1036">Break da Bank Again slot </a>and <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/video-slots/jungle-jim-el-dorado-microgaming-game-review/">Jungle Jim El Dorado slot</a>, to name a few.</p>

<h2 id="playtech">Playtech</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/playtech">Playtech </a>was founded back in 1999 in Tartu Estonia by entrepreneurs from the casino, software engineering and multimedia industries. They provide reliability, as well as security, multilingual platforms and not forgetting superb graphics and high speed. In 2001, Playtech welcomed its first casino license. Since the launch of their software they grew very quickly and were listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006, which made this a very momentous year for the brand. 2006 was also the year Playtech expanded by opening offices in Bulgaria and the years that followed saw the brand growing even bigger with the launch of its sports betting offering and penetration of regulated markets including Italy, Spain, Serbia and Estonia.</p>

<p>Playtech was one of the first software providers that started providing their players with <strong>VIP ratings and comp point schemes.</strong> They were also the first in offering their players the ability to view game and transactions history in real-time. In 2012 Playtech was yet again acknowledged by expanding further with the acquisition of UK&rsquo;s leading sports betting provider, <strong>Geneity</strong>. This success continued through to 2013 with the bolt-on acquisition of <strong>PokerStrategy</strong>, which complimented Playtech&rsquo;s poker offering, as Playtech continued to spearhead the industry&rsquo;s poker offering. Playtech continues to be a world leader in supplying online gaming software, thanks to its innovative thinking and unique cross-platform solution that provides its players with cutting edge games across all platforms via a single login.</p>

Some of Playtech&rsquo;s leading online gaming applications include online casinos, bingo, poker, sports betting, live gaming, casual and fixed odds games.</p>

<p>The amount of software companies producing everyone&rsquo;s favourite games will continue to increase in such a lucrative business as gambling and it is inevitable that these providers will continue to fight for that number one spot by creating innovative and exciting games.</p>
