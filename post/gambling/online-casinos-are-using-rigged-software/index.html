          <p>An ongoing myth with online gambling, which is indeed a very popular myth and one that has originated since the early times, is that <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casino-reviews">online casinos</a> use rigged software. There have been many allegations from players that surround this myth. Some players believe the software is rigged so they will never win, which results in casinos making huge profits. Additionally, they believe that they as a player are not being treated fairly. This myth is very hard to prove or disprove, but the fact is it is important to stick to reputable casinos, as there may or may not be some disreputable casinos that are just out to earn some quick cash. The likelihood of there being disreputable casinos that are just out to make some cash quick is actually quite a big accusation that is unfounded. Scams pop up over the internet in all industries, not just the gambling industry, and with the internet becoming more and more popular every day, it’s only natural that there is also going to be an increase in the amount of online scams. People often have <strong>the misconception that online casinos are a scam</strong>, but this certainly is not the case, and players should have confidence when engaging in an online transaction or when placing a wager at an online casino.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/online-casinos-are-using-rigged-software-3-5a12a1487528f77d5d8b4581.jpg" alt="Online casinos are using rigged software" /></strong></p>

<p>There are, in fact, several reasons online casinos are not rigged and never will be. One of these reasons is the so-called house edge. All casino games online are designed in such a way that the actual casino in question always holds an advantage over the player. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which online casino game you choose to play, because <strong>each of the games offered features the house edge.</strong> Some edges are significant, while others can remain relatively small. Casinos have no reason to cheat and use so called rigged software when they already have the house edge. By having the house edge, they legally hold an advantage over players and will always earn money. If an online casino decided they want to start rigging their games, they would actually risk losing all of their reputable and loyal players, as well as their license and all of their guaranteed, legal earnings. Even though online casinos have the house edge, which ensures they continue to make a profit in order to stay in operation, this does not support any claims of rigged software being used. Winning is in the fairness and luck of the games and without the house edge the fact is that online casinos simply would not be in operation.</p>

<p>Another factor to take into account, when considering whether online casinos use rigged software, is <strong>licensing</strong>. Online casino sites are and always will be officially licensed by governing entities. This means that they get checked on a monthly basis in most cases. The license entities carry out thorough checks on absolutely everything, including <strong>the fairness of the casino games, payout percentages and even checks on how fast a particular casino pays out to their customers.</strong> A reputable casino will usually list information regarding their independent auditors they use on their website. This may also include statistics and the date the casino was last reviewed.  A casino runs the risk of getting their license revoked, thus closing them down, if they are using rigged software. Online casinos that are licensed have to abide by these very high standards of service and have to follow regulatory guidelines, so players should be confident in these licenses.</p>

<p>There are currently hundreds, if not thousands of online casinos for players to choose from. However, when it comes to software creators and providers, there are a lot fewer of them. These software providers create absolutely everything, from the design perspective to the Random Number Generators, so it’s impossible for casinos to make any of their games unfair to players. <strong>Casinos use Random Number Generators</strong> to ensure fair gameplay at all times and reputable casinos consistently have these systems audited. The results of these audits may readily be available on the casino websites for players to read at their own leisure. The companies that make these are billion dollar companies and they are the only ones that would be able to make the games unfair. So, you have to ask yourself: why would a billion dollar company want to risk all of their legal earnings just to make games unfair?!</p>

<p><strong>Legal action</strong> is another good reason online casinos would not use rigged software. If a particular casino is caught cheating their customers, they of course face the possibility of legal action against them which could even result in a prison sentence. Again the question comes to mind &ldquo;why would an online casino risk using rigged software?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How they can one be sure that they do not become a victim of the few disreputable casinos - by sticking to reputable casinos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many players may ask themselves how they can make sure that they do not become a victim of the few disreputable casinos that may be using rigged software. The answer to this is in fact pretty simple: <strong>stick to reputable casinos</strong>. The majority of the world’s top online casinos use major, award-winning software providers to develop safe and trustworthy casino games for their websites. It is very important when looking for an online casino to play in that you look for well-known names like <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/microgaming">Microgaming</a>, <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/netent">Net Entertainment</a> (NetEnt) and <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/software/playtech/games">Playtech</a>, before making your final decision. Online casinos that use these award-winning brands, like Microgaming and Net Entertainment, usually display information on fairness on the casino’s home page or in their Terms and Conditions. Additionally, information about the software developers can also be found on the casino’s website. If your chosen casino is not showing any information on the fairness of the games or on the software developers that provide their games, then you should think twice about playing at this casino, as it is a lot harder to establish their reputation.</p>

<p>Even though all of the above reasons prove and are facts to show that online casinos do not use rigged software, these claims are not completely unfounded. The reason for this is because it is believed that there are hundreds of potentially unscrupulous online casinos in operation today. Players should remember to use diligence when choosing a reputable online casino and base their decisions on software providers and independent audit information. It is also advisable for players and potential players to <strong>read user feedback and reviews</strong> on each individual casinos that can be found on independent online casino websites and online forums. As long as you are careful in choosing the right online casino to play in, the myth that online casinos use rigged software will definitely not be a worry of yours and you can enjoy your online activities in piece. Another final thing to remember is it is possible that this very popular myth has been derived from frustrated casino players who have not won and have lost all of their money in specific casinos. The players out there that have won from a casino will certainly not make such claims.</p>
