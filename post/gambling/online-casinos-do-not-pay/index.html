<h2 id="myth">Myth:</h2>

<p>Online casinos do not pay.</p>

<h2 id="the-facts">The facts:</h2>

<p>When choosing an <a href="https://www.askgamblers.com/online-casino-reviews">online casino</a> it is vitally important to carry out your research first, as the key to having a secure and honourable gaming experience is &lsquo;research&rsquo;. A major factor when choosing a casino is that they are <strong>reputable, safe and that they will pay out your winnings</strong>. Players often believe a myth that online casinos do not pay, when in fact if a player gambles at a reputable casino, the myth that they do not pay couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Legitimate online casinos will always be licensed and regulated and such casinos will employ certified software and responsible payment processors. Casinos are required to have a robust customer identification process, so verifying your identity prior to a cashout is standard procedure. A casino may decide they cannot pay an individual&rsquo;s winnings if the verification procedure cannot be passed. The Gambling Commission which requires casino licenses does not guarantee a player&rsquo;s winnings will be paid. Casinos do, however, have some legal obligations to their players, and gambling debts, under the Gambling Act 2005, become legally enforceable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.askgamblers.com/uploads/original/online-casinos-do-not-pay-5a12a1097528f7675d8b4572.jpg" alt="Online casinos do not pay" /></p>

<p>Online casinos not paying is probably one of the most common complaints submitted against casinos, but of course one of the main reasons people enjoy gambling is for the thrill and excitement of winning, so this very common misconception that casinos do not pay out winnings makes a lot of players very cautious. In certain circumstances, online casinos do reserve the right not to approve a certain payout. In such cases, the refusal of winnings is typically for the protection and security of their players when fraud has been suspected.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that this myth exists, as stories are printed in the media that involve live casinos refusing to pay out jackpot wins to players due to apparent glitches on the machines. It is only natural that gamblers could believe that this is the case for online casinos, too, as it is the same industry. If a player decides to play at a disreputable casino and they request a withdrawal, they may indeed find themselves experiencing certain problems. However, on the flip side of this, a reputable casino will never withhold a player&rsquo;s winnings, unless they are in breach of Terms and Conditions or security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The casino will refuse the player&rsquo;s winnings if a player signs up for a new account using fraudulent information or a fraudulent payment method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of when a player&rsquo;s winnings might be withheld is if a player signs up for a new account using fraudulent information or a fraudulent payment method. The casino is then well within their rights to refuse the player&rsquo;s winnings until the person is able to prove their identity. If players are not able to prove their identity in a certain time frame and if the verification process cannot be placed, this is when a casino will not pay out, but that certainly does not make this myth true. Choosing the right casino to play in is paramount to having a good online experience with the guarantee of receiving any winnings. An online casino can be considered as &lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; if it pays out players winnings and in a timely manner. It is important to check the casino has <strong>a transparent Terms and Condition section</strong> too, and that the casino is licensed.</p>

<p>Online casinos have strict Terms and Conditions that players are required to adhere to. There will always be scenarios where players severely violate these Terms and Conditions and do not receive their winnings as a result of this. However, when these kinds of situations do arise, a reputable casino will typically return the players deposit to them, and may even decide to pay out the winnings, so they can ban the player from their casino. It is important to remember that the Terms and Conditions are there for a reason and, should a player read them and abide them, they should never experience the myth that says that online casinos do not pay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before making a deposit, players need to read Terms and Conditions to avoid any disappointment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All online casinos follow different procedures when it comes to paying out winnings to their players and they all follow different time scales. This can again all be found in the casino&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions, which is important to check before making a deposit to avoid any disappointment. Quite often alternative payment methods and credit card return requests are processed almost immediately. However, other payment methods, such as <strong>checks and wire transfer can take more time to process</strong>. The reason for this is generally because the casino may need to complete additional verification steps. If a casino suspects fraud at any time during a withdrawal process, they are allowed to ask for further identification documents before approving a cash out. This is often the case if it is a player&rsquo;s first withdrawal or if the withdrawal is over a certain amount. Another requirement casinos have in place before they can approve a payout is when it comes to bonuses. If a player decides to deposit and accept a certain bonus from a casino, this bonus will typically carry <strong>a playthrough requirement</strong>. This means that, before a player can request a withdrawal, they will need to play through a certain amount of money. This can usually be monitored in playersâ€™ accounts or via live help. By not meeting wagering requirements, this could result in a withdrawal request being refused and all winnings, including the bonus, being forfeited.</p>

<p>In order to be confident your winnings are going to be paid to you, make sure to do your research first, choose a reputable casino and you will get exactly what you are promised, that is the payout of your important and well earned winnings. Make sure casinos are regulated, so you get fair gameplay and payout standards. Make sure you <strong>choose a reputable software provider</strong>, too. Payout percentages can also be viewed on all games found at a casino which are usually recorded by auditors.</p>

<p>Even though the myth of &ldquo;Online casinos do not pay&rdquo; has originated from somewhere, there is absolutely no evidence to support the fact that all casinos online do not pay out winnings. Generally, if a casino does not pay out to a player, the reason is usually down to the fact that the player has in some way or another breached the Terms and Conditions and is, in fact, not entitled to the winnings. In order to never fall short of your winnings, it is important to read the Terms and Conditions of each and every casino you play in.</p>
